    Comprehensive REST API for SurveyLauncher mobile device management platform.

    The SurveyLauncher backend provides a comprehensive REST API with two distinct interfaces:
    1. **Mobile App API** (`/api/v1/*`) - For Android device authentication and field operations
    2. **Web Admin API** (`/api/web-admin/*`) - For administrative and management functions

    The API follows a consistent JSON format with proper error handling and response structures,
    implementing enterprise-grade role-based access control (RBAC) with nine specialized roles.

    ## Authentication
    Most endpoints require JWT token authentication via the `Authorization` header:
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
    ```

    ## Role-Based Access Control
    The API implements enterprise-grade RBAC with nine specialized roles:

    ### 🟢 App + Web Roles (Hybrid Access)
    - `TEAM_MEMBER` - Field users
    - `FIELD_SUPERVISOR` - Frontline supervisors
    - `REGIONAL_MANAGER` - Regional leadership

    ### 🔵 Web Admin Only Roles (Web-Only Access)
    - `SYSTEM_ADMIN` - Full system administrator
    - `SUPPORT_AGENT` - Customer support
    - `AUDITOR` - Compliance auditor
    - `DEVICE_MANAGER` - Device management
    - `POLICY_ADMIN` - Policy administrator
    - `NATIONAL_SUPPORT_ADMIN` - National-level support
